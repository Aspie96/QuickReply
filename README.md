QuickReply Reloaded
===================
Extended possibilities to use the QuickReply feature.

This is the package that you need to use to migrate from the old vendor.

## How to migrate from `Tatiana5` to `BoardTools` vendor safely?
Please note that the sequence of actions is important.

1. Disable the previous QuickReply Reloaded extension.
2. Delete all files from `ext/tatiana5/quickreply`.
3. Copy [all files from this repository](https://github.com/Tatiana5/QuickReply/archive/migrate.zip) to `ext/tatiana5/quickreply`.
This step will save your data so that they will not be deleted on the fifth step.
4. Upload [new files from BoardTools/QuickReply repository](https://github.com/BoardTools/QuickReply/archive/master.zip) to `ext/boardtools/quickreply`.
5. Click "Delete data" button for the previous QuickReply Reloaded extension. If you have done the third step correctly, your data will not be lost.
6. Remove the directory `ext/tatiana5/quickreply` with all its files from your server.
7. Enable new QuickReply Reloaded extension in the ACP.

Done!
